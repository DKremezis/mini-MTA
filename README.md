# mini-MTA
A mix of Object Oriented programming, GUI (JavaFx) and navigating algorithms.
Project was set up with IntelliJ IDEA.
This program represents a mini implementation of NEW YORK's MTA subway mapping. 
It does not include all trains lines or all train stations and most importantly is 
not intended as an official navigator of New York's MTA subway. 
The program was set up for college promotional use only. 
Basic information was retrieved from the MTA website. 
For more detailed and updated information visit the MTA official Website.
